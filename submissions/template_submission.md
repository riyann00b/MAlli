MAlli

## Project Description    
MAlli is an AI-powered Personal Finance Manager and Expense Tracker built during the Appwrite Hackathon. It offers users a comprehensive solution to manage their finances, track expenses, and gain AI-driven insights into their spending habits. The application combines traditional expense tracking features with advanced AI capabilities to provide a unique and powerful financial management tool.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
The inspiration behind MAlli came from the growing need for smarter, more intuitive personal finance tools. Many people struggle to manage their finances effectively, often lacking insights into their spending patterns or failing to stick to budgets. By leveraging AI, we aimed to create a tool that not only tracks expenses but also provides personalized insights and advice, making financial management more accessible and effective for everyone.
